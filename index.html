<!-- If we use the <p> tag to write a program,the poem will be displayed in a single line,as the <p> tag just ignores all the spaces  and enters we insert in it.This is called the poem problem.We can use the <pre>> element to write a poem. Using this gag will let is break the lines in the poem wherever it's necessary.The HTML <pre>> element defines preformatted text.The text inside a <pre>> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually courier), and it preserves both space and line breaks.-->
